# HotelFinder-WebD

This is a Django implementaion of one of my other project, a Hotel Scraper(https://github.com/arin17bishwa/glugwintermentorship)

During making of this project, only one scraper was working correctly(Tripadvisor), so I have used only this one scraper.

This webapp lets anyone search for a location and get hotels near that location as provided by a normal Google search.
It uses Google Custom Search API to make the google searches and picks the results whose scrapers are available in the code(currently only Tripadvisor).
Additionally, users can save the hotels for future reference if they are registered and logged in, and see those under Account tab.
